To bringup a particular robot add the argument

```bash
robot:=<name>
```

To specify the initial position of the robot in the world, use the `x_pose` and `y_pose` arguments when launching.

## Worlds
By default there are two main worlds:

- AWS Small Warehouse
- AWS Small House

You can add more worlds by putting them inside the [`quadstack_gazebo/worlds`](quad_stack/quadstack_gazebo/worlds/) folder. To launch the simulation with the AWS worlds, follow the next steps

### Export the model Path
**AWS Warehouse**
```bash
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/home/ws/src/quad-stack/quad_stack/quadstack_gazebo/worlds/aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world/models
```

**AWS House**
```bash
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/home/ws/src/quad-stack/quad_stack/quadstack_gazebo/worlds/aws-robomaker-small-house-world/models
```

### Add the world argument on bringup
**AWS Warehouse**
```bash
world:=aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world/worlds/no_roof_small_warehouse.world
```

**AWS House**
```bash
world:=aws-robomaker-small-house-world/worlds/small_house.world
```

Custom worlds can be used similarly.


## Neural Teleoperation
To teleoperate the robot to collect rosbags or for any other purpose, use the following command. You can specify the `robot` and `world` parameter as described in the previous section

```bash
ros2 launch quadstack_bringup teleop.launch.py
```


## Visual Odometry
To launch visual odometry, the main launch line is as follows

```bash
ros2 launch quadstack_bringup odometry.launch.py
```

Along with this, there are several command line arguments that can be specified:

1. `robot` as usual
2. `world` as usual
3. `x_pose`, `y_pose` as usual for the initial robot position
4. `use_kinematics_odom` (bool, default=`true`): this allows you to use leg odometry to reset the VO if it gets lost.
5. `rosbag` (bool, default=`false`): this specifies whether a rosbag is going to be played after launching instead of real time simulation
6. `real_robot` (bool, default=`false`, only works when rosbag=`true` and `robot:=silver_badger/go2`): this specifies if the rosbag is from a real robot or from simulation


## SLAM
To launch SLAM, the main launch line is as follows

```bash
ros2 launch quadstack_bringup slam.launch.py
```

Along with this and similar to the VO launch, there are several command line arguments that can be specified:

1. `robot` as usual
2. `world` as usual
3. `x_pose`, `y_pose` as usual for the initial robot position
4. `use_kinematics_odom` (bool, default=`true`): this allows you to use leg odometry to reset the VO if it gets lost.
5. `rosbag` (bool, default=`false`): this specifies whether a rosbag is going to be played after launching instead of real time simulation
6. `real_robot` (bool, default=`false`, only works when rosbag=`true` and `robot:=silver_badger/go2`): this specifies if the rosbag is from a real robot or from simulation
7. `use_laser_stabilization` (bool, default=`true`): whether to stabilize laser scan from depth images based on IMU values
8. `use_vel_map_constraints` (bool, default=`true`): whether to add leg odometry computed velocity constraints to the SLAM factor graph.



## Navigation
To launch navigation, the main launch line is as follows

```bash
ros2 launch quadstack_bringup navigation.launch.py
```

There are two ways to perform navigation:

1. Navigation and SLAM
2. Navigation on a known map

If option 1. is used, then the launch arguments are the same as in the SLAM launch section. If not, there is an additional argument:

`map` (string, default=`''`): Allows you to specify the path to a known `yaml` map. To use this option specify the full absolute path to the map.



## Autonomous Exploration
Autononous exploration is the combined process of navigation and mapping an unknown environment. We use a frontier based exploration strategy implemented [here](https://github.com/robo-friends/m-explore-ros2). This repository should have already been installed as part of the setup process.


Launch the navigation, and in another terminal launch the following
```bash
ros2 launch explore_lite explore.launch.py
```

A separate set of SLAM and navigation parameters for exploration are available:

1.For Navigation params: [this line](https://github.com/dyumanaditya/quad-stack/blob/main/quad_stack/quadstack_navigation/launch/navigation.launch.py#L24) needs to be changed to use the file `nav2_unitree_explore.yaml` (similarly for the mab robots).
2. For SLAM params: [this line](https://github.com/dyumanaditya/quad-stack/blob/main/quad_stack/quadstack_localization/launch/slam.launch.py#L19) needs to be changed to use the file `slam_toolbox_params_explore_sim.yaml`.
